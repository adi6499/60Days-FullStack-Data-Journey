### Results
- Accuracy: **100%**
- Perfect precision, recall, and F1-score for all three species.
- Confusion Matrix: All predictions correct.

### Learning
- Random Forest = ensemble of Decision Trees (bagging).
- Works well on small, clean datasets like Iris.
- No overfitting visible due to clear class separation.

### Next Step
→ Compare with Gradient Boosting to see how “boosting” differs from “bagging”.
